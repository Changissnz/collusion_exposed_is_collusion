# Collusion Exposed is Collusion  

Nothing screams more of Southern hospitality.

And this guy is working in private industry.

So that's what all the talk of money is about.

Backdoors nowadays mainly stay on the internet.

So that's what ethnic minorities in America do for a living, given how hard the economy is nowadays.

It's just a job. How much can it pay to live in the city? But still...these are the forces at play.

Oh, now I get it. Americanos Stock Market. Nvidia ahtimo. Made in Taiwan. Rebranded as American.

The cybersecurity industry for you. What a life...from army to soldier of fortune.

It looks like someone didn't like the Peking Duck they were served. Quacks.

What a world we live in! AI revolutionaries, then AI reactionaries, and somehow, it's like the wrong things are getting smarter...machine?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

So socialism is a thing in the US. Don't be fooled by the front page tycoon shows. Family values...socialist. Cultural initiatives...socialist. And wealth re-distribution... 
also socialist.

What a great question. Depends on the complex. All questions are equal, but some questions are better for intellectual pursuit, others better for 
political ambition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to todays's globalized world. There are always questions with the sourcing and the allegiance. So a little is good. But a lot is bad. Some rule.  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_fm3bxgfm3bxgfm3b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9657e60-2f49-4f1e-97fc-d1ccc6c6e01b" />

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

If only the free market didn't need so much protection. Fortune is not easy without family. But fortune doesn't need family either. Hmmm... looks like a hard question 
to answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

A lot of feelings and plans when it comes to using people. We all get that.  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_tfh6frtfh6frtfh6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9eef0d2-3425-4b37-acfd-3d32451f2d73" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Business is usually to increase wealth. Communist. Fascist. Capitalist. Doesn't matter. Is this just a fool complaining? 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_daavv2daavv2daav" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb6774f3-21d0-4f75-b341-8ddb598cbbae" />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Say again, how great solidarity is when there is so much to do and so much to fight for. Definitely not ingredients for civil discontent.  

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_f69cnqf69cnqf69c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/671d151b-ab4d-4d26-b8db-314d8112693f" />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And that's why people don't really joke anymore, so idiocracy runs unchecked. I hope the old man and his partners had their fun. After the fact...get settled down, married, 
Christian happily ever after. Or Buddhist. Or Jewish. Or Muslim. If the onion fits...you know how a lot of girls and old men are, so whimsical in their beliefs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

There's a lot of crazy people in this world. If it's not the cops that go nuts, it's the friend and their friends. Or maybe family, animals, teachers, social workers, 
normal people on the outside. It's like dynamite. Don't light it up. 

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_oxtzz2oxtzz2oxtz" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11007508-c240-463a-a522-e3475e3a4cbc" />

Interesting statement. I suppose it's all a matter of perspective. If you're white, that's evangelical capitalism. If you're black, that's poetic justice. And if you're 
Asian, obviously very Chinese, Chinese being the center of Asia.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

How alarming, right? First, the news was always ranting about how dangerous AI can be to people. AI being like space race weapons of mass destruction. Incredulous to believe, 
yet this cartoon generated by AI seems to be so realistic and truthful. Who knows anymore in this weird world?

Good advice. From a professional advisor. The man is on his knees, he's going through a crises, he reaches out for help, and receives it. Spells good evidence for a land of 
opportunity.

How kind of him to teach sensitivity training and Chinese dominoes when the other man did not have enough to buy Dominoe's Pizza. I don't care who you are, poor, rich, 
barbarian, big bad American, we all need friends.

There, you have it. Can't trust politicians or bankers. Can't live without them either. Education? Bought and paid for by bankers. Security? Administration runs on politicians' 
legislation. Trade and commerce? If global is best, then global it is.

Name a person that can be trusted, and they'll be worth as much as ten BMWs, but worth less than eleven BMWs. Name a person that is an icon, and they're uglier than half their 
peers out there, dumber than the other half of their peers, but have opinions worth about ten BMWs. And that's why some people are angry about that. Hollywood style.
